DONE: Make the slider dashboard app
DONE: Which oscar view handles the homepage?
DONE: Modify the homepage view to add the slider information to the context
DONE: Slider
The slider section has:
 - A background image (1920X422)
 - A slider
A slider has 4 components:
 - The slider image (374x386) (416x420)
 - Slider title
 - Slider message
 - Slider call to action button

 I will need to make a custom app to store the slider information. The app will need to have a dashboard section to enter the slider information. In the frontend it will not have any views. The catalog main view need to be modified to add the slider's information to the context.

 Teh custom app will be called frontend and will handle, beside the sliders, any other special component that cannot be programmed using the base oscar apps or models.

 Model:
 name
 image
 title
 message 
 button-text
 url

 DONE: Promo Banners - Will need to make an app alot like the slider custom app
